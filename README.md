# Heart-Disease-Dashboard

I found a dataset covering heart disease and decided to try and make a dashboard. I first had to convert the data from solid numbers into readable data ( 1 = Male, 0 = Female). I then had to clean the data and replace empty cells and NaN cells. After the data was cleaned, I then inserted the data into multiple pivot tables that were used to create different charts. I then took the charts and meshed them into a customizable dashboard that allows the end user to use slicers to determine which information is presented.
